## Development Philosophy

Following best practices from the agentic coding runbook:

### Core Principles
- **Planning is Everything**: Create comprehensive plans before implementation
- **Think in Workflows**: Execute AI Developer Workflows (ADWs), not just prompts
- **Be Specific**: Provide clear instructions and course-correct early
- **Leverage Parallelism**: Use multiple approaches for complex tasks
- **Commit Often**: Remembering things is hard. Use git commits as a log of progress to use as a persistent memory store.

### Workflow Process
1. **Explore**: Review existing codebase and documentation thoroughly
2. **Plan**: Create detailed PRDs and implementation plans with clear acceptance criteria
3. **Execute**: Implement with incremental verification and testing
4. **Review**: Test comprehensively and iterate based on feedback
5. **Document**: Update documentation and commit with proper context

### Quality Standards
- Follow TDD approach when appropriate
- Use visual iteration for UI/UX work
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Maintain privacy-first architecture
- Ensure on-device processing where possible
- Always test builds after working and address any failures or warnings
- Ensure all files end with a single new line
